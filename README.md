# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis

This is a beginner-friendly data analysis project based on the **Titanic dataset from Kaggle**. As part of my learning journey into data science and Python, I explored the data to uncover survival trends among passengers aboard the Titanic.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand the structure and features of the Titanic dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Use Python (Pandas, NumPy, etc.) to analyze and clean data
- Visualize key patterns and survival trends
- Practice logical thinking with real-world data

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (via Kaggle)

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Higher survival rates were observed among **women and children**.
- Passengers in **higher classes (Pclass 1)** had better survival odds.
- There were noticeable differences in survival based on **gender, age, and ticket class**.

## 📂 Dataset Source

The dataset is publicly available as part of the [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) competition on **Kaggle**.

## 🚀 What's Next?

This is just one of my early steps into the world of data. I'm currently:

- Learning more about data wrangling and preprocessing
- Exploring classification models to predict survival
- Improving my storytelling through better visualizations
